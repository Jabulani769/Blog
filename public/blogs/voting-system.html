                    So here is the story: It was that time of the semester when we were required to present our project ideas. 
                    I had absolutely <i>no clue</i> what i was going to build — brain blank, zero inspiration. 
                    And then ... When it was time to announce the project idea i just blurted out, <span class="text-[#9a7d0a]">"I'll build a voting system".</span>    
                    <i>Hell nah.</i> Did I just say that? But hey, thats how my very first voting system project was born — unexpectedly we might say LOL!
                </p> <br>

                <h1 id="why-c" class="text-[24px]">Why C for the system?</h1>
                <p>
                    I know some programmers out there had this question. 
                    At the time, we were learning C programming language, so naturally, I was just supposed to do so. <i>(But yeah, I plan on recreating it in C++ soon).</i>
                </p> <br>

                <h1 class="text-[24px]">What it does</h1>
                <p>
                    The system has two main users: the <span class="text-[#9a7d0a]">admin</span> and the <span class="text-[#9a7d0a]">voter</span>. 
                    Here are the key functions of the system: <br> <span class="text-[#9a7d0a]">1. Admin first :</span>
                </p>
                        <details>
                            <summary class="cursor-pointer">Regester candidates to the system.</summary>
                            <div class="bg-[#9a7d0a63]">
                                <p>To register candiate the system takes input 3 inputs</p> 
                                <ul class="list-disc pl-10">

                                    On this part I really hard to dig deep. 
                                    I had no idea on how i was going to show the results on the terminal.
                                    So i googled way how i can present info on the terminal, and i came across ASCII graphics.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </details>
                <p class="mt-4"><span class="text-[#9a7d0a]">2. Voter :</span></p>
                <p>
                    The voters platform is as simple as entering your voterID, waiting for the system to verify if your registred into the system.
                    It checks the regFiles for the matching ID.
                </p><br>
             
                <h1 id="behind-scene" class="text-[24px]">Behind the scenes</h1>
                <p>
                    I started by sketching out the flow diagrams to plan every stage of the voting process. 
                    There are two main portals in the system: <b class="text-[#9a7d0a]">Voter Portal</b> and the <b class="text-[#9a7d0a]">Admin Portal</b>, where one needs a secret code to enter the admin portal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the data — <i class="text-[#9a7d0a]">candidates, voters, votes and used voterID's</i> are stored in <i class="text-[#9a7d0a]">.txt files</i>. 
                    I wanted keep things simple, light and offline.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>One unique part:</b> While building the voting system, one important feature I needed was to group candidates based on the position they’re contesting for.
                    Sounds simple, right? But since candidates were being registered one by one into a flat file (without any structure like a database), 
                    I had to figure out a way to dynamically detect which positions existed and group candidates accordingly — all with just arrays and logic in C.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    So I created a mechanism to scan through all registered candidates, identify each unique position, and store it in a list. 
                    That way, when it came time to display candidates during the voting phase, 
                    I could easily show all candidates under the same position grouped together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And for the results? I built a basic <b>ASCII graph</b> using loops and <b>#</b> symbols to visualise vote counts per candidate.
                    Here is a peek of the code.
                </p>

                <h1 id="security" class="text-[24px]">Security & Admin Access</h1>
                <p>
                    Security was a big deal for me. Here's how it works:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Users can only vote once. The system tracks their ID and marks it as used after voting.
                    To access admin features, a secret code must be entered.
                    The admin can view the results and manage candidates and voters, but they <b>can't edit data</b> (to prevent internal corruption).
                    Exiting admin mode also requires another code, just to make it more security spice.
                </p><br>
                
                <h1 class="text-[24px]">Growth from the Grind</h1>
                <p>
                    Challenges? So many, but here are a few noticable ones :
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grouping candidates by position — Building a vote counter that visually shows results 
                    — Creating a secure, two layer access system — And oh debugging, <b>LOTS OF IT</b>.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I had to read through so much C documentations just to get certain things right.
                    But in the process, I improved drastically in file handling, loops, and especially string manipulation using the <span class="font-mono font-bold"><mark class="bg-gray-400">#include &lt;string.h&gt;</mark></span> library.
                    Overall working on this project taught me — How to organize C programs into <b>modular functions</b>. 
                    The power of <b>structures</b> and <b>advanced loops</b>. Most importantly, how to think like a <b>developer</b> not just a coder.  
                </p><br>

                <h1 id="whats-next" class="text-[24px]">What's Next?</h1>
                <p>
                    I might have taken a brake from it for a moment, but am not done with it yet. 
                    I'm planning to: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>— add a database support</li>
                        <li>— Introduce aunthentication systems</li> 
                        <li>— most importantly Build a GUI version</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also thinking of open-sourcing it, so that other devs and students can learn from it, improve it or even build their own.
                </p><br>

                <h1 id="final-thoughts" class="text-[24px]">Final Thoughts</h1>
                <p>
                    This whole thing started as an slip of the tongue. 
                    But I ended up learning so much, not just about C programming, but about problem-solving, security 
                    and building something that actually works.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    So yeah... Sometimes the best projects start with I might say a: <i>"Wait... did I just say that?</i>
